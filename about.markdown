This is the personal github site for Brendan's personal files. He's using a long term  ID xasperated that came about after spending what seemed like a whole afternoon creating a new personal ID for slashdot. (Which tells you how long ago I created it.).

There isn't much code or other files, because I really got interesting in using github after looking at another users personal repository and wondered about the github.io pages and management.

So this is all about going down a rabbit hole and focusing on the tech to deliver the content, instead of the content. A thing I do a LOT.
